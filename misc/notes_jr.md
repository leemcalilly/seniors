Hi Lee-
Please see attached a presentation that was completed last fall.  The
colorations were adjusted from another presentation background that I liked.
Like the idea of utilizing images of older residents, too.  Haven't given a
logo much thought.  The trademark is for Senior Living Sustainability Guide.
By we could use the SLSG letters if that helps for a logo.  In terms of key
words that describe what we are doing: integrated team, collaboration,
cooperation, communication, commitment, cooperation, and compassion all come
to mind.  Let me think about a tag line.  I just wrote up the attached last
night that I thought could be used for some of the home page verbage.
Thanks.
Jane
