# Notes on Revisions


## Override the footer partial
For the bottom of each page of the website, we want this to be the statement:
 
ÓSenior Living Sustainability Guide is a registered trademark of With Seniors in Mind.   All rights reserved.  

## Set up app on new heroku account (double check amazon and wufoo links)

## Finalize the logo
For the logo, one small request and we’ll go with it…on the left side of the tree, it looks too straight.  Can you curve it in slightly like the left side and then taper it to the base?  I agree that we’ve taken the logo where it needs to go.  I think the contrast in the letters are good too. 

## Registration form
For the registration information sheet:
See Jane’s notes below.
For requested information, please have request either all above the line you type on or all below.
I agree that we should add * means that it is required.

Subject: RE: My Rewrite
 
My only preference would be that it be consistent. Either all over or all under. How do other websites do it?

By the way, do the two red dots mean "required"? Usually fill-out forms state "red spots mean required" specifically. 

We're getting there....

Hi Jane-
Just so you are aware, the photos that are on the test site are just holders until I get additional photos to Lee.  
Want to make sure that I understand for the fill-in for registration, would you prefer them to be above the line or below the line that you are typing on?  Please let me know and Ill look at it again, too.
Thanks for all your support!
Jane
