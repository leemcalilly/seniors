# Current Logo Changes

Hi Lee-
Here’s the comments from the Committee, which were overall very positive:
Want to see additional contrast between background and lettering, so we may need to tweak a little bit more.
Would like to see a broader base on the tree, so that it looks more grounded.
One comment on wanting to see some leaves ‘falling’ from the tree.
One comment wanting to see capital letters on the senior living sustainability guide, but I think that will compete with the SLSG.
Quite a few “I like it so much, terrific, looks great, distinctive, etc.”
So maybe a couple of tweaks and we’ll have it.  Everyone is very excited about the website. 
I’ll get some of the information to you for the content.  I’m going to ask everyone if they have pictures that they want to share as well. 
I’ll be back in the office tomorrow and can work on some additional pieces.  I re-wrote the information for the opening page based upon some comments from one of my committee members.
Thanks!
Jane


Here are a couple additional comments.
One is to make sure tree looks broader at the bottom and connected to the “earth”, similar to other comments.
Jane is 80, so if the green-grey may seem to grey with the aging eye.  So we may need to ‘brighten’ just a little bit.
Jane’s other comment, is to make sure that the logo reads in black & white as well as in color, so when we use it, we can print off a black and white version and it will still read.
Thanks.
Jane
