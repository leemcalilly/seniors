# Current Comments on the site
Hi Lee-
A couple of items regarding the site:
1. When someone downloads the Guide, I would like them to register, so we can keep a listing of who is registering to use the Guide.
2. I’ll need a page for Volunteer Committee Members that have contributed content and information for the guide.  I’ve requested a picture and contact information from the different committee members and that is starting to trickle in.  I can provide you this information as soon as I receive it.
3. I’ve also asked the committee to provide images that they would like to see on the website.  The images will most likely want to move a little slower than they do now, and I’m assuming that can be adjusted.  I’ll work on sending some as I get those in, too.
4. We’ll need a page for references & resources, so we can list different websites and information.
5. I’ve attached revised verbage for the “About” page based upon comments from one of my committee members.
6. I’ll need a couple more days to get you a final PDF for the Guide itself.  I have a new introduction that goes in the Guide from one of the committee members that I need to finalize and read through the Guide one more time.  We are working on four additional files that will also be downloadable.  They are Excel spreadsheets.
7. Currently we’ll need to use the “TM” symbol for Senior Living Sustainability GuideÔ  Shortly we will be able to use the Ò symbol, but not quite yet.
I’m still working on getting the logins done, etc.  I’ll keep you posted.  Thanks.
Jane

# Current Logo Changes

Hi Lee-
Here’s the comments from the Committee, which were overall very positive:
Want to see additional contrast between background and lettering, so we may need to tweak a little bit more.
Would like to see a broader base on the tree, so that it looks more grounded.
One comment on wanting to see some leaves ‘falling’ from the tree.
One comment wanting to see capital letters on the senior living sustainability guide, but I think that will compete with the SLSG.
Quite a few “I like it so much, terrific, looks great, distinctive, etc.”
So maybe a couple of tweaks and we’ll have it.  Everyone is very excited about the website. 
I’ll get some of the information to you for the content.  I’m going to ask everyone if they have pictures that they want to share as well. 
I’ll be back in the office tomorrow and can work on some additional pieces.  I re-wrote the information for the opening page based upon some comments from one of my committee members.
Thanks!
Jane


Here are a couple additional comments.
One is to make sure tree looks broader at the bottom and connected to the “earth”, similar to other comments.
Jane is 80, so if the green-grey may seem to grey with the aging eye.  So we may need to ‘brighten’ just a little bit.
Jane’s other comment, is to make sure that the logo reads in black & white as well as in color, so when we use it, we can print off a black and white version and it will still read.
Thanks.
Jane
